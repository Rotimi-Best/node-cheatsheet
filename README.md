Testing Node js functionalities before implementing into my project

# Purpose
Repo was created to allow me store all my nodejs test when I see a new functionality (to me) in the terminal. Allowing me to be able to come back to it when necessary

# Idea
If you think I should structure my code better, please make a pull request and update it.
